Undergraduate Intern on The Design of Limited Memory Quasi-Newton Methods for Unconstrainted Large-Scale Optimization
==========================================================
The repository collects the first project did by Youthy, in his undergraduate study. It is about low rank (limited memory) quasi-Newton methods. 

Details of the methods were summarized in [the report](https://github.com/YouthyWang/Low-Rank-Least-Change-Update/blob/main/Report.pdf). Some simple implementations and codes of numerical tests written by the author could be found in the file *LRQN-simple-cases*. 

This project was supported by URA Office in [CUHKSz](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en).
